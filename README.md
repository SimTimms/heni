# HENI Technical Test

## Installation

Install with yarn or npm install

Run with yarn start or npm run start

## Use

Scroll to the bottom of the page to requery the spaceX API.

## ENV file

I would normally gitignore this but for the sake of simplicity it's included

## Load More Button

The "Load More" button ideally would change to "No more results" when the returned data feed is empty. I ran out of time for this.
